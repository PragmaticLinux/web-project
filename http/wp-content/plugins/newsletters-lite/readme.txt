= PRO Version =

The Newsletters LITE version has all the features that the PRO version has but it has some limitations.

You can have one mailing list, 500 subscribers, send 1000 emails per month and the custom dynamic fields are not available. These limits should be sufficient for a personal blogger or a small business.

To remove these limits, you can upgrade to the PRO version and submit your serial key inside the plugin.

In addition to the limits being removed, you will receive <a href="http://tribulant.com/support/">priority support</a> from <a href="http://tribulant.com">Tribulant Software</a>.
